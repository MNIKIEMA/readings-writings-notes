# Some Tools can help us understanding
- https://www.deepgraph.co/ visualizes code as graph
- https://deepwiki.com/ is another tool
For example this is the visualisation of [moshi-finetune](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi-finetune) and the result is [here](https://deepwiki.com/kyutai-labs/moshi-finetune)
Why it is useful?
- Understanding new repo code
- Improve our architecture of code from the best swes
- Make our code modular and maintainable
Some tools like [pyreverse](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/additional_tools/pyreverse/index.html) or [pymermaider](https://github.com/diceroll123/pymermaider) or [py2puml](https://github.com/lucsorel/py2puml) can help us for documentation.
